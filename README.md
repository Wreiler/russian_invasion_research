# russian_invasion_research
My research aimed at the main aspects of the russian invasion of Ukraine started at 24th of February 2022

This war from the very beginning brings only cruelty, grief and injustice to this world
Many people was affacted, many people died and were injured, many became refugees and emigrants
And it's the point for both sides, because many russian people who not support this war became prisoners for their brave thoughts and actions, but more became politician emigrants and outcasts
And that's all because of the ambitions of one old and mad coward, who's sitting in the bunker, rewriting russian history, lying to everyone and threating the world with nuclear war
That's awful and it needs to be stopped

Peace and слава Україні!

### Description of the analysis

All the datasets are found in open sources on Kaggle

##### According to these datasets, visualization was compiled and presented in 3 dashboards

1. First dashboard is about Ukranian refugees and their movements to nearest countries for safety

    It contains follow visualization types:
    - the war situation description in a text block
    - refugee resettlement map by country
    - total refugees numbers across Europe and aggressor countries
    - a linear graph of changes in the number of refugees by country during all months of the war

2. Second dashboard is about russian losses in this war in different equipment and soldiers

    It contains follow visualization types:
    - losses summary table in the war for each equipment type expressed in incremental losses for each month
    - percentage histogram of Russia's losses for each month and type
    - loss map for different Ukraine regions
    - parameters for selecting the equipment type and a specific region for visual presentation

3. Third dashboard is about air-raid sirens declared on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the war

    It contains follow visualization types:
    - bar graph of the hours total number on alert for each day
    - the Ukraine regions map that were on alert the most during the war
    - hightlight table of the hours on alert total number for each region for the entire duration of the war
    - parameters for selecting a specific month of the war, to view a specific region of Ukraine, and to select an exact date
